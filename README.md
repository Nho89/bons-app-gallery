## Project Structure
* node_modules: This folder contains all the dependencies of your project. When you install packages using npm, they are stored here.

* public: This folder contains static assets like Vite.svg, HTML files, images, and other resources that don't need to be processed by webpack. 

* src: This is where the source code of your React application resides. It typically contains the following subfolders:

1. components: This folder contains reusable React components that make up our application's UI. Each component folder contains the subfolders of styles, CSS files or preprocessor files for styling your components.
2. pages: This folder contains React components that represent different pages/routes of our application.
3. assets: This folder holds static assets like images, fonts, or other media files used in your application.
4. services: This folder may contain modules for interacting with external services or APIs, in this case an archive of Vanilla JS.

* tests: This folder may contain test files for unit or integration testing your components and utilities.
* .git: This folder contains all the Git version control information for your project if you're using Git for source code management.
